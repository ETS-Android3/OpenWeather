## Description
OpenWeather is a weather application that clearly and simply displays the weather for a multitude of cities.

The application is committed to not collecting any user data, only city data is sent to OpenWeatherMaps.

## üîí Privacy 
Privacy is a fundamental right, that's why we only take the bare minimum and we prove it by making the application open-source.

Only the necessary data are used by the application, these data are:
* OpenWeatherMaps API key, only used to retrieve data from registered cities by the user.
* Registered cities, only used to know for which city the application need to search and display data.
